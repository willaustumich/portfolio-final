			<p>Welcome to my website. Whether you’re new to cooking, an expert, or somewhere in between, this site will give you 
				the inspiration needed to become your best chef. By no means would I consider myself a five-star chef, just your 
				garden variety home chef with a passion for making tasty and healthy meals. Ready to get started? Take a look at 
				some of my featured items.</p>

			<p>One great thing about cooking is how every culture and region has a different take on it. Vegetables, herbs, and 
				spices that were available became distinct features in a culture’s dishes, even to this day. I like to try a little 
				bit of everything and am always searching for more information that allows me to treat my kitchen like a teleportation 
				machine into another culture or period in time.</p>

			<p>When they say cooking is just a chemical process at the end of the day, they were right. The level of science that 
				goes into making our food taste delicious is way over my head. What I remember from high school chemistry class is the 
				importance of following the instructions to a T if you want to recreate a result. Cooking is a bit different in this 
				sense though. I rarely make a dish the same way twice. Each dish is a new opportunity for me to put on my lab coat and 
				experiment with slight variations.</p>
