		<p>When I was younger, I was really (and I mean really) into Legos. I probably accumulated over a dozen sets 
			during my childhood and could have had a dozen more if they weren’t so darn expensive. There’s something 
			magical about taking a set of individual pieces and combining them to make something special. Of course, 
			as time went on I started to grow away from the colorful blocks, but I still had a desire of build. That’s 
			where my passion for cooking came in. Instead of taking 50 blocks and building a house, I was able to take 
			a handful of ingredients and spices and turn them into a delicious meal.</p>
		
		<p>If it’s not clear by now, I love cooking. I’m a reformed picky eater who has finally seen the light. I missed 
			out on most foods that weren’t tacos, pizza, and chicken nuggets for years, so I’m making up for it by being 
			adventurous with what I eat and how I prepare it. I love spice, so you’ll see that as a theme in my favorite 
			recipes, but spice is a double-edged sword. I’m a tech guy from a big city, so I spent a lot of time eating 
			processed foods that lacked any nutritional value or was so overloaded with salt and sugar, you could hardly 
			distinguish any other flavors. Because of that, I like to focus on working with natural foods when I can. 
			Fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, herbs, and spices are key to building a memorable meal.</p>

		<p>The recipes on this page are all dishes I’ve made more than once. The key here is to recognize that these recipes 
			are simply guidelines for you to follow. Feel free to step outside them and play a bit with the level of seasoning, 
			the cook times, and the types of ingredients. You might just find that your way is better than mine. If that’s the 
			case, be sure to share your recipe with the rest of us. Don’t be stingy!</p>
